intro: :| dm7/9 | E7/9 |: (played three times)


             | dm7 | E7/9 |
She sends me blue   valentines

        | dm7 |       | E7/9 |
All the way from Philadelphia

   | dm7 |      | E7/9 |
To mark the anniversary

   | am |         | A7 |
Of someone that I used to be

       | dm7 |       
And it feels just like theres

  | E7/9 | am |            | A7 | 
A warrant out for my arrest

       | dm7 |       | E7/9 | am |  | A7 |
Got me checkin in my rearview mirror

        | dm7 |       | E7/9 |
And I'm always on the run

            | am |         | A7 |
Thats why I changed my name

      | B7 |             | B7 |       | E7/9 |
And I didn't think you'd ever find me here

(same as above:)

(note: you can play | dm7/9 | instead of | dm7 | on the first three lines
       of the following verses. i think he always plays the | dm7/9 |-chord
       but doesn't always make it up to the e'-string.)

To send me blue valentines
Like half forgotten dreams
Like a pebble in my shoe
As I walk these streets
And the ghost of your memory
Is the thistle in the kiss
And the burgler that can break a roses neck
It's the tatooed broken promise
That I hide beneath my sleeve
And I see you every time I turn my back

solo
(same chords as verse)

She sends me blue valentines
Though I try to remain at large
They're insisting that our love
Must have a eulogy
Why do I save all of this madness
In the nightstand drawer
There to haunt upon my shoulders
Baby I know
I'd be luckier to walk around everywhere I go
With a blind and broken heart
That sleeps beneath my lapel

She sends me my blue valentines
To remind me of my cardinal sin
I can never wash the guilt
Or get these bloodstains off my handa
And it takes a lot of whiskey
To take this nightmares go away
And I cut my bleedin heart out every nite
And I die a little more on each St. Valentines day
Remember that I promised I would
Write you...

      | dm7 | E7/9 |
These blue  valentines

| dm7/9 | E7/9 |
blue    valentines

| dm7/9 | E7/9 | am |
blue    valen - tines

 <pre>
 Capo 4

        D                             F#m
Well my time went so quickly, I went lickety-split-ly
G      A      D  Dsus4  D 
Out to my ol' 55
        D                   F#m
And I pulled away slowly, feelin' so holy
    G                    A
God knows I was feelin' alive


Chorus
        D     A      G    A
Now the sun's comin' up
     D           A    G    A
I'm ridin' with lady luck
  D      A       G
Freeway, cars & trucks
 A                  D  Dsus4  D
Stars beginning to fade
 A                 D  Dsus4  D
And I leave the parade
 A                  Bm
Just a wishin' I'd stayed a little longer
 E7                            A7
Oh lord, lemmetellya theres a feelin' gettin' stronger


And its 6 in the morning, gave me no warnin'
I have to be on my way
Well there's trucks all a-passin
and the lights all a-flashin'
I'm on my way home from the place

Well my time went so quickly, I went lickety-split-ly
Out to my ol' 55
And I pulled away slowly, feelin' so holy
God knows I was feelin' alive

         D     A     G   A
Now the sun's comin' up
      D         A    G   A
I'm ridin' with lady luck
  D       A      G    A
Freeway, cars & trucks ( x 4 )

 Bdim= xx0101

Intro


Dm  Bbm F Bdim   /    Gm7 A7sus4   /    A7 Dm Gm-A7-Dm
1)
           Dm                           Bbm
Well she's up against the register with an apron and a spatula,
      F                              Bdim  
With yesterday's deliveries and the tickets for the bachelors
           Gm7                     A7sus4            A7
She's a moving violation from her conk down to her shoes,
          Dm          Gm    A7      Dm
But it's just an invitation to the blues

         Gm                          C7
And you feel just like Cagney, she looks like Rita Hayworth
         F
At the counter of the Schwab's drugstore
           Gm                                 C7
You wonder if she might be single, she's a loner and likes to mingle
F                            A     A7   Dm   A7
Got to be patient, try and pick up a clue

           Dm                           Bbm
She said "How you gonna like 'em, over medium or scrambled?",
          F                          G
You say "Anyway's the only way", be careful not to gamble
      Gm7                      A7sus4         A7
On a guy with a suitcase and a ticket getting out of here
      Dm                      Bbm
In a tired bus station in an old pair of shoes
             A7sus4            A7             Dm
This ain't nothing but an invitation to the blues
               Gm                           C7
But you can't take your eyes off her, get another cup of java,
            F
And it's just the way she pours it for you, joking with the customers
      Gm                              C7
Mercy mercy, Mr. Percy, there ain't nothing back in Jersey
         F                     A            A7
But a broken-down jalopy of a man I left behind

       Dm
And a dream that I was chasing,
   Bbm
a battle with booze
       A7sus4    A7            Dm
And an open invitation to the blues


                 Gm                       C7
But she used to have a sugar daddy and a candy-apple Caddy,
       F                               F
And a bank account and everything, accustomed to the finer things
            Gm                                 C7
He probably left her for a socialite, and he didn't love her 'cept at night,
      F                              A
And then he's drunk and never even told her that he cared
        Dm 
So they took the registration,
       Bbm
And the car-keys and her shoes
      A7sus4                A7              Dm
And left her with an invitation to the blues (...solo sax)


                  Gm                            C7
'Cause there's a Continental Trailways leaving local bus tonight, good evening
 F                                  F
You can have my seat, I'm sticking round here for a while
          Gm                      C7
Get me a room at the Squire, the filling station's hiring,
    F                                     A
And I can eat here every night, what the hell have I got to lose?
       Dm
Got a crazy sensation,
      Bbm
Go or stay? now I gotta choose,
        A7sus4             A7           Dm
And I'll accept your invitation to the blues

  <h2 class="anchor" id="stuff4"> Downtown train </h2>
  <pre>
  
  intro: :| D | G - A |:

| D |      | G - A |   | D |
Outside another yellow moon

              | G - A |             | D |  
Has punched a hole in the nighttime, yes

                    | G - A |              | D |  
I climb through the window and down to the street

    | G - A |       
I'm shining like a new dime

| G |        | A7 |          | G |             | A7 |
The downtown trains are full with all of those Brooklyn girls

| G |               | A7 |
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds


(same as above:)

Well you wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that will ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Be careful of them in the dark
Oh, if I was the one you chose to be your only one
Oh baby can't you hear me now, can't you hear me now

   | D |            | G - A | D |          | G - A |
   Will I see you tonight    on a downtown train

   | D |      | G | G / F# - em |  | A7 |
   Every night it's just the same, you leave me lonely now

(same as above:)

I know your window and I know it's late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light at the four-way
You watch them as they fall, oh baby, they all have heart attacks
They stay at the carnival, but they'll never win you back

   Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
   Where every night, every night it's just the same, oh baby 
   Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
   All of my dreams they fall like rain, oh baby on a downtown train

Solo: | D - G | D - A7 | D - G | A7 |
      | D - G | D - A7 | D - G | A7 | A7 |

   Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
   Where every night, every night it's just the same, oh baby 
   Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
   All of my dreams just fall like rain, all on a downtown train

(repeat intro theme here:)

All on a downtown train, all on a downtown train
All on a downtown train, a downtown train
